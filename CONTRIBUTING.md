# Contribution Guidelines

This document contains a set of guidelines which any contributions to _any_ parts of repository must follow.

[If you disagree with something here, you should open up an issue to discuss making a change!](https://github.com/arjavjain0703/cbse-ai/issues/new)

## GitHub Flow

Feel free to create a fork and propose your changes as a pull request. We will review your changes and merge them into the main branch if they are appropriate.

## Branch Names

Branch names should adhere to the following:

- All lowercase
- `-` as space separator for branch names
- If a feature branch, include the name of the feature

## File Names

File names should follow the following guidelines:

- All lowercase
- `-` as a space separator for dates in file names
- Dates in `DD-MM-YY` format

## Git Commits

In order to ensure that our git history makes sense we have certain guidelines which we require contributors to adhere to. These are:

### Commits should follow the commit standards

We do not enforce any particular way to commit but we do have a set of standards which we would like you to follow. These are:
- Be clear with the changes
- Make short and concise commit messages
- Create different commits for backend and frontend changes
- Commits should be one logically unit of change.

A logical unit of change can be thought of as completion of a single task.

A good way to figure out if you are not adhering to this rule is to tell yourself what you changed ("I added a picture of a donkey to the Twilio workshop"). If you find yourself having multiple statements in this description then you have made your commit too big.
